    "While there have been very large scale results that have seen success of trying to predict crime and using analysis to try to reduce the amount of crime all of these have used very complex and high-end computing systems.  This project take an innovative approach due to much smaller computing ability than compared to current systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We showed that we have shown that given a crime is committed that from historical data we can figure out whether or not the criminal will be caught.  This is extremely useful for us because it gives us a probability matrix of whether or not a criminal will be arrested given that a crime occurs, we could use this and the distribution of crimes committed, along with a societal \"cost\" for a type of crime and from there we can figure out where we should place officiers to help reduce the cost that crime has on society.  This work will not be covered due to the need for more computing power and the idea of trying to calculate societal cost of crime is a hard problem to do with the given information and no easy way to collect more of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This classifier also shows us that the task is possible, even when restricting the data and using a simple classifier.  This classifier could be used to help rearrange locations where officiers are placed.  We could use A/B testing and find a optimial placement for maximizing arrest rates.  This would improve Chicago's safety."

    "It would be interesting to see correlation between where officers are placed and the amount of crime reported.  This is due to the fact that the data given to us is biased.  We can see this bias in the fact that 27 types of crimes have a 100% report to arrest rate, meaning that they most likely are types of crimes that are not reported, but are arrested for if an officer sees you.  This is probably some form of selection bias on the part of the populus of Chicago.  The data required to find where officiers are located is a requirement that this project was unable to recieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public perception of crime is also an interesting area of study, and the difference in arrest rates could be used for such a study.  Above we showed that there are two types of crimes when it comes to arrest rates, ones with very high arrest rates and ones with very low arrest rates.  This difference can be important to see if we can use this information to predict the effect these crimes have on other people.  For example, if we have a high arrest rate for a type of crime, it is possible that for that type of crime people do not perceive it to affect time, thus they rarely report.\n",
    "\n",
    "A study could also be done to try to isolate which pieces of information are being used by the SVM.  This would be useful for us trying to find underlying trends in crime rates.\n"
